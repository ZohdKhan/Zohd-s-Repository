This Python project involves the implementation of a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict the most dominant political affiliation in each county in the United States.

Available in this directory is the source code file, which is a Jupyter Notebook file, and the corresponding report file, which is in PDF format. However, the report is embedded/written in the jupyter notebook file itself, so both files are essentially the same from a viewing perspective.
