**NOTE**: Unfortunately, the display of some of my code for my projects in the corresponding pdf files is being cut off due to formatting issues when I perform the pdf conversion process. However, the reports are embedded/written into corresponding jupyter notebook (.ipynb) files themselves, so the ipynb and pdf files are essentially the same from a viewing perspective. Therefore, it would be most convenient to view the ipynb files instead of the pdf files. I apologize for the inconvenience, but thank you for taking the time to look at my work.
